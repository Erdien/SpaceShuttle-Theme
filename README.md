# SpaceShuttle-Theme
This is a dark theme for Windows 10 (I didn't tried it on older versions)<br>
To use it - you have to double-click on the *.theme file,
or move the theme in file explorer to ```%appdata%\..\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes```, go to high contrast options:<br>
[ms-settings:easeofaccess-highcontrast](ms-settings:easeofaccess-highcontrast)<br>
and turn high contrast mode on.
<br>

to turn it on/off on web browsers - you have to go to browser flags:<br>
[about://flags#forced-colors](about://flags#forced-colors)<br>
and swich the`Forced Colors`flag to **Enabled** or **Disabled**.
